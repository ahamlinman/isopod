# Isopod

Isopod is a Linux daemon that watches a CD-ROM drive, rips the discs inserted
into it, and then rsyncs the resulting ISOs to remote storage in the background.
While it works on any system with the required dependencies, it's designed for
use on a Raspberry Pi with a special E-Ink status display, to support easy
operation by non-technical users.

**Isopod is not designed to rip audio CDs or copy-protected media.**
You are fully responsible for ensuring that your usage of Isopod complies with
all laws that you may be subject to. For the record, my original use case for
Isopod is to help back up family videos that were previously transferred from
8mm tape to DVD-Rs that are slowly but surely [rotting away](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_rot).

Isopod is a relatively new personal project, and is largely undocumented.
Further information about Isopod and the terminal hardware may be provided in
the future.
