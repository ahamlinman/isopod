# isopod.service normally manages the E-Ink status display, but not if it
# crashes or fails to start in the first place. Since isopod.service depends on
# isopod-connected.service, which allows about 3 minutes of restarts before it
# actually fails, we delay the display refresh with a timer so the Conflicts=
# setting on isopod.service can cancel it.
